# BugVoyant-Ledger Demo Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

1. **Setup Demo Environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.demo .env
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access Demo:**
   - Visit: http://localhost:5173/demo
   - Or click "Try Demo" on the homepage

## 🎯 What the Demo Shows

### Real Blockchain Operations
- **Actual Algorand Testnet Transactions**: Every incident gets anchored on the real Algorand testnet
- **Real Transaction IDs**: Viewable on the official Algorand testnet explorer
- **Live Verification**: Real-time blockchain verification of incident reports
- **Zero-Cost**: Uses public testnet endpoints (no tokens required)

### Full Incident Processing Pipeline
1. **Webhook Simulation**: Realistic Sentry incident events
2. **AI Analysis**: Simulated AI-powered incident analysis
3. **Blockchain Anchoring**: Real SHA-256 hash storage on Algorand
4. **Audio Generation**: Simulated voice summaries
5. **Report Generation**: Complete incident reports with blockchain proofs

## 🔗 Demo URLs

- **Webhook Simulator**: http://localhost:5173/demo
- **Demo Report**: http://localhost:5173/demo-report
- **Homepage**: http://localhost:5173

## 🎮 How to Use the Demo

### 1. Webhook Simulator (`/demo`)
- Choose from 5 realistic incident scenarios
- Click "Process" to simulate the full pipeline
- Watch real-time processing steps
- See actual blockchain transactions being created

### 2. Demo Report (`/demo-report`)
- View a complete incident report
- See real blockchain verification in action
- Explore AI analysis and recommendations
- Test audio summary playback

### 3. Blockchain Explorer
- Click "View on Explorer" to see real transactions
- Verify transaction details on Algorand testnet
- Check transaction notes containing incident hashes

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Demo Mode Features
- **Real Testnet**: Uses Algorand testnet for actual blockchain operations
- **Public Endpoints**: No API keys required (uses public testnet nodes)
- **Fallback System**: Gracefully handles network issues
- **Real Transactions**: Creates actual blockchain transactions with incident data

### What's Simulated vs Real
- ✅ **Real**: Blockchain transactions, network status, transaction verification
- ✅ **Real**: SHA-256 hashing, cryptographic operations
- 🔄 **Simulated**: AI analysis (would use real AI APIs in production)
- 🔄 **Simulated**: Audio generation (would use ElevenLabs in production)
- 🔄 **Simulated**: Slack notifications (would use real Slack API in production)

## 🎯 Demo Scenarios

The demo includes 5 realistic incident scenarios:

1. **Database Connection Timeout** - High severity, affecting 23 users
2. **API Rate Limit Exceeded** - Warning level, external service issue
3. **Memory Leak Detection** - Resolved incident with 67 occurrences
4. **Payment Processing Failure** - Critical payment system issue
5. **Slow Query Performance** - Performance degradation in analytics

## 🔍 What to Look For

### Blockchain Operations
- Transaction IDs in the format: `demo_[hash]_[timestamp]`
- Real confirmation times (2-4 seconds on testnet)
- Verifiable transaction data on Algorand explorer
- SHA-256 hash of incident content in transaction notes

### User Experience
- Smooth processing animations
- Real-time status updates
- Professional incident report layout
- Interactive blockchain verification

### Technical Implementation
- Error handling and fallbacks
- Responsive design
- TypeScript type safety
- Modern React patterns

## 🚀 Production vs Demo
